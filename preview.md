For my soundscape, I'm following the thoughts and actions of a student in class. In my soundscape so far, I have some audio recordings of myself that are meant to be the thoughts of a bored student in a class they really don't want to be in. I also have some ticking sounds of a clock, some writing sounds, and some pen clicking sounds. I wasn't really able to arrange them in the order I want them to be in since I still have a lot more to add. I kind of just added the files to the soundscape and spent some time messing around with effects and trying to think about what else I want to add/how I want to arrange it, so that's why it doesn't really sound like anything at all except for a bunch of random thoughts. 

I think my next steps will be to plan out in my head how I want my soundscape to sound, and then make a physical layout of all the sounds I want to add and how I want to layer them. After that, I'll be able to see more clearly what other sounds I have to record and how I want to edit my clips.

My one worry about my project is that it will be a little boring. I want it to be comedic and relatable to any students listening to it, but I'm worried that it won't be interesting enough or tell enough of a story to really catch the listener's attention. I'm not sure what kinds of risks I'd be able to take with this, though, because overall it seems pretty safe.
