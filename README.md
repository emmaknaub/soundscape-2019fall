# "Class Thoughts"

This soundscape narrative is a look into the mind of a student during a class that they don't want to be in. It highlights the thoughts that run through the student's head while the professor is teaching and they are not paying attention and shows the lengths that the student will go to to avoid being in class. This project is meant to be relatable (while hopefully not *too* relatable) to the student listening, and have a slight comedic edge.
